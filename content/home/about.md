# Biography

Hello everyone!

I'm a Computer Engineering student @ Politecnico di Milano and I love every little thing that beeps and blinks! I enjoy doing computer security challenges with my team, [Tower of Hanoi](https://toh.necst.it), especially the reverse engineering ones! You will find some of my writeups in here and in my team's site.

In my spare time I play my drumset at home and when it's night time and my neighbors don't want to listen to my lovely crafted music I also play some videogames.

Here are my profiles on various wargaming sites:
